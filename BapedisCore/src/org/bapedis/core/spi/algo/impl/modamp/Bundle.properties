NetCharge.name=Net charge
NetCharge.desc=Compute the net charge Z of a peptide sequences at a certain pH Z(pH=5, pH=7, pH=9) with a default pka scale (IPC_Protein).
IsoelectricPoint.name=Isoelectric Point
IsoelectricPoint.desc=Compute the isoelectric point of a peptide sequences. Isoelectric point (pI) is a pH in which net charge of protein is zero.
MolecularWeight.name=Molecular Weight
MolecularWeight.desc=Compute the molecular weight of a peptide sequences.
BomanIndex.name=Boman Index
BomanIndex.desc=Boman index is the sum of the free energies of the respective side chains for transfer from cyclohexane to water taken from Radzeka and Wolfenden and divided by the total number of the residues of an antimicrobial peptide.
HydrophobicMoment.name=Hydrophobic Moment
HydrophobicMoment.desc=Compute the max averaged hydrophobic moment. The averaged hydrophobic moment are calculated using a rectangular window of size n.
