GraphDistance.name=Graph Distance
GraphDistance.desc=The average graph-distance between all pairs of nodes. Connected nodes have graph distance 1. The diameter is the longest graph distance between any two nodes in the network. (i.e.  How far apart are the two most distant nodes).
GraphDistancePanel.closenessCheckBox.text=Closeness Centrality
GraphDistancePanel.normalizeCheckBox.text=Normalize Centralities in [0,1]
GraphDistancePanel.betweennessCheckBox.text=Betweenness Centrality
GraphDistancePanel.eccentricityCheckBox.text=Eccentricity
GraphDistancePanel.betweennessCheckBox.toolTipText=Measures how often a node appears on shortest paths between nodes in the network.
GraphDistancePanel.closenessCheckBox.toolTipText=The average distance from a given starting node to all other nodes in the network.
GraphDistancePanel.eccentricityCheckBox.toolTipText=The distance from a given starting node to the farthest node from it in the network.
