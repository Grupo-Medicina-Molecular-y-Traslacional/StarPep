Measure.category=Measure
BetweenessCentrality.name=Betweenness centrality
BetweenessCentrality.desc=Measures how often a node appears on shortest paths between nodes in the network.
Property.normalize.name=Normalize
Property.normalize.desc=Normalize values in [0,1]

GraphDistance.name=Similarity-based centralities
GraphDistance.desc=Similarity-based centralities to identify central nodes in a similarity network. Connected nodes have network distance 1-similarity. The diameter is the longest graph distance between any two nodes in the network.
GraphDistance.centralities.name=Centralities
GraphDistance.centralities.desc=Centralities
GraphDistance.closeness.name=Closeness Centrality
GraphDistance.eccentricity.name=Eccentricity
GraphDistance.closeness.desc=The average distance from a given starting node to all other nodes in the network.
GraphDistance.eccentricity.desc=The distance from a given starting node to the farthest node from it in the network.
